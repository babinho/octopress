Let's get this clear, this is not a rant against anyone, this is just a
statement. But you must realize this, it is not easy and this is not a one
week fix. Also, I'm not talking about leaving your job and finding a better
one, but improving yourself as a developer. If that consequently gets you a
better job, be it that way.

The first thing you need to do is decide for yourself that you want to do it.
There are lots of 9-5 developers out there that write their amount of code
while at work, then clock out and they are done. I assume you are not one of
them.

So how do you do it? I don't know yet. I'm trying to find out just like you
are. Writing a blog is a good thing, so you will learn to articulate
your thoughts, or so they say. Don't be discouraged by the lack of topics, or
afraid of bad reception, you want people to respond to your work, so you can
improve it and be better at it.

Be constructive while appraising someone's work, maybe it's the best they have 
it in them, or maybe it could be a start of a great career and you ruin it with 
your critic. Talking about that, develop a thick skin, learn a way do
weed out non constructive critic, and take the one you get in a best way
intended. Not everyone is a bestseller writer, or a computer language creator.

Invest yourself into opensource projects, there are
lots of resources on starting out. You can join or even start a local
developers or something_users group, something being a language or framework
you like and use. But first and foremost, you must be open to learn, every day
everything that crosses your path is a chance to learn. I'm not talking about
code or tools or even technology in that sense. If you've got the time take a
look at the [Passionate
Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer),
it's a great book by [Chad Fowler](http://chadfowler.com/). He is also posting
the chapters free on his blog for people to read. I can't recommend this book
more.

Learn a new programming language, learn a functional programming language,
make a mobile app, make a desktop app, make a web app, step out of your
comfort zone and take a look how other developers are doing it.

Go outside, take a deep breath, exercise, take care of your health. Read
another book: [The Healthy
Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/jkthp/the-healthy-programmer), and enjoy
your life a bit differently than while sitting in a chair in some cubicle in
the middle of nowhere.

Do some freelance work, on the side or full time, that will give you the
opportunity to try out new technologies, learn how to deal with clients, learn
project management, estimating, scheduling and everything you are not doing while 
_just coding 9-5_.

So the conclusion is, learn every day, learn something different, step out of
the box and be yourself, the best you can be. You can leave a dent in the
universe, maybe a small one, but it doesn't matter. Just try and not be a
drone.
