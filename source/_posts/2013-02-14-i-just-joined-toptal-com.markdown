## [<img src="/images/toptal.png" title="Toptal" class="left" />](http://www.toptal.com/?ref=3341)[Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/?ref=3341) is a relatively new company, similar in many ways to other freelancing sites available, but it has a twist.

<a href="http://www.toptal.com/profiles/3341/resume?ref=3341" class="right"><img src="/images/toptal_resume.png" title="My Toptal Resume" class="right" /></a>
I received an email from a recruiter last month and after a few hours inspecting the site,
and watching the CEO's talk at the Harvard Business School
[http://youtu.be/Ffjx_hl3IE8](http://youtu.be/Ffjx_hl3IE8) i decided to contact them.
I first had a nice chat with the recruiter explaining in depth what the company does and what can
be our mutual benefits if i continue to pursue the arrangement. Later that day i was contacted by the CTO
and scheduled a skype call with him. The skype call was a first test, [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/?ref=3341)
cares that all developers are very fluent in English, not only written, but also in spoken form.
The interview was no stress at all, a standard chat between two engineers that just met.
After that i received the next test, solving some automated tests. 
The tests weren't really complicated but the time is limited to 45 minutes, i could write about the perils of automated testing,
but that isn't the case there, it's just one of the screens. Interview number 3 was a pair programming session where another
developer joined my shared screen session and gave me assignments, also solving some algorithms, but with him watching me writing code.
After i passed that test, there was another, to create an AJAX web application with REST API and authentication.
I did my best on a limited schedule and passed that test too and became a member of a growing number of their network of senior freelance developers.

To save you the trouble, i'll write something about [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/?ref=3341) and why they are not the same as Elance, Odesk or other freelance sites.
[Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/?ref=3341) hires freelance engineers, then tests them, and has people
working with them and the clients to find the best match for the engineer and the client.
That way you already get tested and able engineers to work with them.
Also the engineer is instructed in detail about the job he is interviewing for and can prepare for it.
All of the recruiters are engineers so it makes the stuff easier because everyone understands the problems.
You as a client, have the possibility to try out a few developers until you find one that suits you and can hire them either part or full time whatever suits you.

The bottom message is: If you are in need of top talent to develop you application or you are a skilled developer who wants to work for some of the best companies in the world join [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/?ref=3341) and give us a try.
